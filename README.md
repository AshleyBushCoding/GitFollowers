GitFollowers is an api endpoint designed to grab the followers of a given userId (up to 5 followers). 
It takes those followers and finds their followers (again, up to five followers)
It takes those followers and finds their followers (again, up to five followers per person).

For api implementation:

1) Make sure you have both git and python (3.7) installed locally, or that you are able to run both on your PC.

2) Download the code in this repo locally. Make sure that all files (FollowerId, api) are in the api folder

3) Start the api by running the api script on the command line (after navigating to the folder with the api from the command line, use "python api.py", without quotes. This may be slightly different depending on your python version and OS. This was done in Windows 10 in the terminal.)
Navigation tips: can do "cd" to change the directory (no quotes), and if you use quote marks around the file path, you don't have to
use escape characters on spaces in the file name. Ex: cd "C:\Downloads\VMTest\GitFollowers\api" , and then you can start the program.

4) Navigate the api by going to the appropriate page:

Homepage: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Followers page: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/followers?id=NAME&maxFollowers=NUMBER , replacing NAME with the username of the GitHub user searched for, and NUMBER with the max number of followers for the user you want returned (maximum is no more than 5 per user).
  Full example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/resources/followers?id=jskeet&maxFollowers=2
  
  Note that:
  1) maxFollowers is an OPTIONAL parameter. It has a default of 5 followers. It can be omitted from the query without issue.
  2) maxFollowers will be capped at 5 to prevent timeouts on the PC (each call will increase the base by a power of 5. It will get large quickly).
  

Finally, this is an unauthenticated application. As such, there can only be so many requests from the same IP per hour before the user is prevented from using the website. 

From https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting:

"For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows for up to 60 requests per hour. Unauthenticated requests are associated with the originating IP address, and not the user making requests."
